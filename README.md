## About Localazy's Example Project

The project and it's construction are detailed in (link to the article).
There are two versions of the project, the one hosted on GitHub was made to be compatible with PHPSandbox so we just changed the URL's in the `example.blade.php` file and the redirection in the `web.php` so the project's web page opens right away with PHPSandbox. The second version is made to work with Laravel's artisan server and is in detail in the link above.
